Teach-Bot is a Slack App aimed at helping teachers run more effective classes via Slack. We have augmented the existing slack functionality with new features that help with teaching tasks like collecting assigments and making announcements much easier so teachers can focus on being teachers. 


### Getting Started

```bash
git clone git@github.com:teach-bot/teach-bot.git
cd teach-bot
script/setup
```
